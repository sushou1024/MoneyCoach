## Filters
Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.

### Symbol filters
#### PRICE_FILTER
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
    "minPrice": "0.00000100",
    "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",
    "tickSize": "0.00000100"
  }

The PRICE_FILTER defines the price rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

- minPrice defines the minimum price/stopPrice allowed; disabled on minPrice == 0.
- maxPrice defines the maximum price/stopPrice allowed; disabled on maxPrice == 0.
- tickSize defines the intervals that a price/stopPrice can be increased/decreased by; disabled on tickSize == 0.
Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the price filter. In order to pass the price filter, the following must be true for price/stopPrice of the enabled rules:

- price >= minPrice
- price <= maxPrice
- (price-minPrice) % tickSize == 0
#### LOT_SIZE
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
    "minQty": "0.00100000",
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"
  }

The LOT_SIZE filter defines the quantity (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

- minQty defines the minimum quantity allowed.
- maxQty defines the maximum quantity allowed.
- stepSize defines the intervals that a quantity can be increased/decreased by.
In order to pass the lot size, the following must be true for quantity:

- quantity >= minQty
- quantity <= maxQty
- (quantity-minQty) % stepSize == 0
#### MARKET_LOT_SIZE
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE",
    "minQty": "0.00100000",
    "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"
  }

The MARKET_LOT_SIZE filter defines the quantity (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for MARKET orders on a symbol. There are 3 parts:

- minQty defines the minimum quantity allowed.
- maxQty defines the maximum quantity allowed.
- stepSize defines the intervals that a quantity can be increased/decreased by.
In order to pass the market lot size, the following must be true for quantity:

- quantity >= minQty
- quantity <= maxQty
- (quantity-minQty) % stepSize == 0
#### MAX_NUM_ORDERS
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
    "limit": 200
  }

The MAX_NUM_ORDERS filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.

Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

#### MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS",
    "limit": 100
  }

The MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS filter defines the maximum number of all kinds of algo orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.

The algo orders include STOP, STOP_MARKET, TAKE_PROFIT, TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET, and TRAILING_STOP_MARKET orders.

#### PERCENT_PRICE
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",
    "multiplierUp": "1.1500",
    "multiplierDown": "0.8500",
    "multiplierDecimal": 4
  }

The PERCENT_PRICE filter defines valid range for a price based on the mark price.

In order to pass the percent price, the following must be true for price:

- BUY: price <= markPrice * multiplierUp
- SELL: price >= markPrice * multiplierDown
#### MIN_NOTIONAL
/exchangeInfo format:

  {
    "filterType": "MIN_NOTIONAL",
    "notional": "5.0"
  }

The MIN_NOTIONAL filter defines the minimum notional value allowed for an order on a symbol. An order's notional value is the price * quantity. Since MARKET orders have no price, the mark price is used.
